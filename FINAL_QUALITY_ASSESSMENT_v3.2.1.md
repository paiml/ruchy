- **Memory Efficiency**: Memory estimation and tracking implemented
- **Benchmarking**: Performance measurement framework available

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas
- ✅ **Technical Debt**: Zero SATD maintained
- ✅ **Security**: Zero vulnerabilities  
- ✅ **Dead Code**: Completely eliminated
- ✅ **Core Functionality**: 905 library tests passing

### Medium Risk Areas
- ⚠️ **Integration**: 3 integration tests failing (expected - features not implemented)
- ⚠️ **Documentation**: Minor documentation gaps
- ⚠️ **Coverage**: Baseline maintained but could be improved

### Areas Requiring Future Attention
- 📈 **Code Entropy**: 15,575 violations (requires systematic approach)
- 📈 **Feature Completeness**: Some language features not fully implemented
- 📈 **Large Scale Testing**: Need more testing with large datasets

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
1. **Address Remaining Complexity**: Fix final 9 complexity violations
2. **Implement Missing Features**: Fix 3 failing integration tests
3. **Documentation Pass**: Address 3 documentation violations

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Entropy Reduction**: Systematic approach to reduce 15K entropy violations
2. **Coverage Increase**: Targeted coverage improvement in specific modules
3. **Performance Optimization**: Use benchmark framework for optimization

### Long-term Quality Strategy
1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular PMAT quality gate enforcement
2. **Automated Quality**: Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD quality gates
3. **User Testing**: Real-world usage scenarios and feedback collection
