## [0.4.7] - 2025-08-18 (EMERGENCY QUALITY RECOVERY)

### CRITICAL FIXES (CEO-Mandated Emergency Response)
- **Variable Binding Corruption**: Fixed critical bug where let bindings were overwritten with Unit values
- **Transpiler println! Generation**: Fixed transpiler generating invalid `println()` instead of `println!()` macros  
- **One-Liner -e Flag**: Implemented missing `-e` flag functionality that was advertised but non-functional
- **Function Call Evaluation**: Fixed functions being stored as strings instead of callable values
- **Match Expression Evaluation**: Implemented missing match expression evaluation with wildcard patterns
- **Block Expression Returns**: Fixed blocks returning first value instead of last value
- **:compile Command**: Fixed session compilation generating invalid nested println statements

### QUALITY ENFORCEMENT  
- **Mandatory Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks enforcing complexity <10, zero SATD, lint compliance
- **Complexity Reduction**: Reduced parser from 69 to <10, REPL evaluator to <8, type inference to <15
- **Lint Compliance**: Fixed all 15+ clippy violations across codebase
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Removed false feature claims, updated to reflect actual implementation status

### STATUS AFTER RECOVERY
- **Core Language**: ✅ Expressions, variables, functions, control flow working
- **REPL**: ✅ Interactive evaluation with persistent state working
