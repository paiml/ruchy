# Changelog

All notable changes to the Ruchy programming language will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - Phase 3 In Progress

### Discovered Features (Already Implemented)
- **Enhanced Pattern Matching** - All advanced patterns already work!
  - Pattern guards with `if` conditions: `n if n > 0 => "positive"`
  - Range patterns: `1..=10 => "small"` (inclusive), `1..10` (exclusive)
  - Or patterns: `1 | 2 | 3 => "small numbers"`
  - Complex combinations of all pattern types

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-23 (PHASE 2: STANDARD LIBRARY COMPLETE)

### 🎉 Major Achievement
**Phase 2 Standard Library Foundation Complete!** This release transitions Ruchy from Phase 1 (Infrastructure) to Phase 2 (Standard Library), making it a viable DevOps/scripting language.

### Added

  - Pure procedural scripts auto-wrapped in `main()`
  - Mixed functions + top-level statements execution order
  - User-defined `main()` + top-level statements work together
  - DevOps/scripting paradigm fully supported
  - Example: `let config = "prod"; fun main() { println("Config:", config); }` works perfectly

- **File I/O Operations** (STDLIB-004)
  - `read_file(filename)` - Read text files into strings
  - `write_file(filename, content)` - Write strings to files
  - Essential for configuration management and logging
  - Full filesystem interaction for DevOps scripts

### Discovered Working Features

- **DevOps Ready**: Natural scripting with file I/O and functional programming

### Examples
```ruchy
// Top-level configuration
let environment = "production";
let servers = ["web-01", "web-02", "api-01"];

// File operations
write_file("config.txt", environment);
let config = read_file("config.txt");

// Functional programming
let web_servers = servers.filter(|s| s.starts_with("web"));
let report = web_servers.map(|s| "✅ " + s).reduce("", |acc, s| acc + s + "\n");

fun main() {
    println("Deployment Report:");
    println(report);
}
```
