  - Root cause: While loops were returning body values instead of Unit
  - Fix: evaluate_while_loop now always returns Value::Unit
- **FIXED**: Object.items() method transpilation failure
  - Root cause: Transpiler converted items() to iter() with wrong signature
  - Fix: Now converts to `iter().map(|(k,v)| (k.clone(), v.clone()))`

#### 🎯 Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
- **4-Layer Testing Strategy** implemented to prevent regressions:
  1. **Golden Master Testing**: SQLite-style exact output verification
  2. **Language Invariants**: Mathematical property-based testing

- ✅ Functions: Determinism guarantees
- ✅ REPL/File: Output consistency verified

#### 🏆 Result

```

## [1.9.2] - 2025-08-24

### 🚨 Critical Fix: Format Strings Now Work!

This emergency release fixes the #1 blocker that was preventing Ruchy from being usable for real work.

#### Fixed
- **Format strings in REPL**: `println("Result: {}", x)` now correctly outputs `Result: 42` instead of `Result: {} 42`
- **Multiple placeholders**: `println("{} + {} = {}", 1, 2, 3)` works correctly
- **Mixed types**: String and numeric values can be mixed in format strings
- **Expressions in format args**: `println("Sum: {}", a + b)` evaluates expressions

#### Impact
- **ruchy-book compatibility**: Jumps from 19% → ~40% (estimated)
- **rosetta-ruchy**: All algorithms can now display their results properly
- **Real-world usability**: Format strings are essential for any practical programming

#### Technical Details
The REPL's `evaluate_println` function was simply concatenating arguments with spaces instead of processing format placeholders. Now it:
1. Detects format strings by checking for `{}` placeholders
2. Evaluates all format arguments
3. Replaces placeholders with values in order
4. Falls back to space-separated concatenation for non-format cases

#### Tests Added
Comprehensive test suite in `tests/format_strings_test.rs` covering:
- Simple format strings
- Multiple placeholders
- Mixed types
- Expressions in arguments
- Format strings in loops
- Edge cases

- **List Support**: Arrays flow through pipelines correctly
- **Method Chaining**: Full support for method calls in pipeline stages
- **Function Calls**: Regular functions work as pipeline stages
- **Complete FP**: Functional programming paradigm fully enabled

### Examples Working:
```ruchy
42 |> println                          # Function calls
[1,2,3] |> dummy.len()                 # Method calls → 3
[1,2,3] |> dummy.reverse() |> dummy.first()  # Chaining → 3
"hello" |> dummy.to_upper() |> dummy.reverse()  # String pipeline → "OLLEH"
```
