# ROADMAP.md - Ruchy Master Execution Plan

## 🎯 FOUNDATION PRIORITIES

**PRIMARY FOCUS**: CLI/REPL/"one liners" and functional programming are our base.

1. **REPL Excellence** - Flawless interactive experience (Elixir/Julia quality)
2. **Functional Core** - Pure functions, immutability, composition
3. **One-Liner Power** - Complex data processing in single expressions
4. **CLI First** - Every feature works from command line before GUI/IDE

*See docs/execution/ for detailed task execution framework*

## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES (2025-08-20)

### CLI/REPL Foundation ✅
```bash
# All of these now work:
ruchy -e "println('hello world')"                    # ✅ Basic eval
ruchy -e "2 + 2" --format json                       # ✅ JSON output
ruchy -e "[1,2,3].sum()"                            # ✅ List methods
ruchy script.ruchy                                   # ✅ Script mode
echo "2 + 2" | ruchy                                # ✅ Stdin mode
ruchy --verbose -e "match x { 1 => 'one', _ => 'other' }" # ✅ Verbose mode
```

### Functional Programming Core ✅
- ✅ List methods: sum, reverse, head, tail, last, len, map, filter
- ✅ String methods: upper, lower, trim, split, len
- ✅ Lambda syntax: both `\x -> x + 1` and `|x| x + 1`
- ✅ Result/Option types with Ok, Err, Some, None
- ✅ curry/uncurry support for functional composition
- ✅ Pattern matching with match expressions
- ✅ List comprehensions transpiling to map/filter

### Performance Optimizations ✅
- ✅ Arena allocator for AST nodes (safe Rust, no unsafe)
- ✅ String interner for identifier deduplication
- ✅ Lazy evaluation for pipelines with memoization
- ✅ Bytecode caching with LRU eviction (1000 entry default)
- ✅ Expression cache for parsed ASTs and transpiled code

### Developer Experience ✅
- ✅ Enhanced error diagnostics with source highlighting
- ✅ Helpful error suggestions (Elm-style)
- ✅ --json flag for structured output
- ✅ --verbose flag for debugging
- ✅ Multiline REPL input with continuation detection
- ✅ REPL commands: :help, :history, :clear, :bindings, :type, :ast

## 🚀 NEXT PRIORITIES

### Week 1: Complete REPL Polish ✅ COMPLETED (2025-08-20)
- [x] Tab completion for keywords/functions (rustyline autocomplete) ✅
- [x] Pretty-printed DataFrames in REPL ✅
- [x] History with fuzzy search (Ctrl+R) ✅
- [x] Syntax highlighting in REPL input ✅
- [x] :save command to save session to file ✅

### Week 2: Missing Core Features
- [ ] Actual reduce implementation (currently only syntax)
- [ ] map/filter/reduce with proper lazy evaluation
- [ ] Async/await runtime execution (not just transpilation)
- [ ] Module system with proper imports
- [ ] Package manager integration (cargo-like)

### Week 3: DataFrame & Actor Runtime
- [ ] DataFrame REPL evaluation (currently only transpiles)
- [ ] Polars backend integration for DataFrame ops
- [ ] Actor runtime with actual message passing
- [ ] Supervision trees implementation
- [ ] MCP protocol server support

### Week 4: Type System & Inference
- [ ] Bidirectional type checking implementation
- [ ] Generic type parameters in functions
- [ ] Trait bounds and implementations
- [ ] Type inference for let bindings
- [ ] Algebraic data types (enums)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT

### Critical Fixes Needed
1. **Reference operator (`&`)** - Currently unsupported, breaks actor tests
2. **Self in actors** - No actual self.field access implementation
3. **Format strings** - Need proper f-string interpolation
4. **Method calls on collections** - HashMap/Vec methods not working
5. **Import resolution** - Module system incomplete

### Performance Bottlenecks
1. **Parser allocations** - Arena allocator created but not used
2. **String interning** - Infrastructure ready but not integrated
3. **Lazy evaluation** - Module exists but not connected to pipeline
4. **Cache integration** - BytecodeCache not used in REPL yet

## Task Execution Protocol

**All development follows CLAUDE.md protocol:**

1. **LOCATE** specification section in SPECIFICATION.md
2. **FIND** task ID in docs/execution/roadmap.md  
3. **VERIFY** dependencies completed via DAG
4. **IMPLEMENT** with <10 complexity
5. **COMMIT** with task reference: `git commit -m "REPL-P0-001: Add one-liner support"`

**Active Sprint**: CLI/REPL Foundation (our base)

src/runtime/repl_v2.rs       10    Document or remove
benches/repl_latency.rs       7    Convert to #[ignore]
```

### Hour 3: Split Parser Modules
```
Priority targets:
1. parser/mod.rs (47 complexity) - Split into submodules
2. parser/actors.rs (33 complexity) - Simplify handler parsing
3. parser/collections.rs (32 complexity) - Extract list/map logic
```

├── Mon: Started with 262 clippy errors
├── Tue: Parser improvements
├── Wed: Type system work
├── Thu: REPL stabilization
├── Fri: Achieved 0 clippy errors ✅
└── Today: Fix SATD + split transpiler

Features/week: ~5
Debt reduction: -262 clippy, -124 SATD pending
```

## 🚦 Decision Matrix

```
Before ANY code change:
1. Check file complexity (max 10)
2. Check file size (max 500 lines)
3. Zero SATD tolerance
4. Run: make lint && make test

If modifying:
├── transpiler.rs → STOP, split first
├── parser/actors.rs → Reduce complexity first
├── Any REPL file → Remove SATD first
└── Other files → Proceed with caution
```
