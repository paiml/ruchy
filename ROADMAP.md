# ROADMAP.md - Ruchy Master Execution Plan

## 🎯 FOUNDATION PRIORITIES

**PRIMARY FOCUS**: CLI/REPL/"one liners" and functional programming are our base.

1. **REPL Excellence** - Flawless interactive experience (Elixir/Julia quality)
2. **Functional Core** - Pure functions, immutability, composition
3. **One-Liner Power** - Complex data processing in single expressions
4. **CLI First** - Every feature works from command line before GUI/IDE

*See docs/execution/ for detailed task execution framework*

## 🌟 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS - REPL/CLI Foundation Sprint

### Week 1: One-Liner Support (CRITICAL PATH)
```bash
# These MUST work by end of week:
ruchy -e "println('hello world')"                    # Basic eval
ruchy -e "[1,2,3] |> map(|x| x*2) |> sum()"          # Pipeline
ruchy -e "df.read_csv('data.csv').groupby('x').mean()" # DataFrame
ruchy script.ruchy                                     # Script mode
echo "2 + 2" | ruchy                                  # Stdin mode
```

### Week 2: REPL Polish
- Tab completion for all keywords/functions
- :help with executable examples
- Pretty-printed DataFrames
- Multiline input with proper indentation
- History with fuzzy search (Ctrl+R)

### Week 3: Functional Programming Core
- Higher-order functions in REPL
- Pattern matching expressions
- Monadic error handling (Result/Option)
- Function composition operators (>>, <<)
- Partial application syntax

## Task Execution Protocol

**All development follows CLAUDE.md protocol:**

1. **LOCATE** specification section in SPECIFICATION.md
2. **FIND** task ID in docs/execution/roadmap.md  
3. **VERIFY** dependencies completed via DAG
4. **IMPLEMENT** with <10 complexity
5. **COMMIT** with task reference: `git commit -m "REPL-P0-001: Add one-liner support"`

**Active Sprint**: CLI/REPL Foundation (our base)

### IMMEDIATE FOCUS: REPL as Primary Interface
```
The REPL is not a feature - it's THE PRODUCT.
Every user's first experience is the REPL.

Golden Path Requirements:
1. Zero-friction startup (just type 'ruchy')
2. Helpful errors with examples
3. Tab completion that actually works
4. :help command with runnable examples
5. Pretty-printed DataFrames by default
6. One-liner mode for shell scripting

Success Metrics:
- New user can be productive in <5 minutes
- Support all examples from README
- Function calls work (println, etc.)
- Pattern matching in expressions
- Pipeline operators for data flow
```

### Priority 2: Advanced Features Alignment
```
Location                    Count  Action
src/runtime/repl.rs          93    Extract to GitHub issues
src/middleend/mir/lower.rs   12    Document or remove
src/runtime/repl_v2.rs       10    Document or remove
benches/repl_latency.rs       7    Convert to #[ignore]
```

### Hour 3: Split Parser Modules
```
Priority targets:
1. parser/mod.rs (47 complexity) - Split into submodules
2. parser/actors.rs (33 complexity) - Simplify handler parsing
3. parser/collections.rs (32 complexity) - Extract list/map logic
```

## 📈 Velocity Tracking

```
Week of Jan 13-17:
├── Mon: Started with 262 clippy errors
├── Tue: Parser improvements
├── Wed: Type system work
├── Thu: REPL stabilization
├── Fri: Achieved 0 clippy errors ✅
└── Today: Fix SATD + split transpiler

Features/week: ~5
Debt reduction: -262 clippy, -124 SATD pending
```

## 🚦 Decision Matrix

```
Before ANY code change:
1. Check file complexity (max 10)
2. Check file size (max 500 lines)
3. Zero SATD tolerance
4. Run: make lint && make test

If modifying:
├── transpiler.rs → STOP, split first
├── parser/actors.rs → Reduce complexity first
├── Any REPL file → Remove SATD first
└── Other files → Proceed with caution
```
