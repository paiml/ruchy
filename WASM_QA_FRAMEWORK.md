# WebAssembly Extreme Quality Assurance Framework v3.0

A comprehensive quality assurance framework for WebAssembly projects implementing production-grade testing, validation, and optimization practices.

## 🎯 Framework Overview

The WebAssembly Extreme Quality Assurance Framework provides a systematic approach to ensuring code quality, security, and performance for WASM projects. It implements a 4-phase quality validation process with specific metrics and thresholds.

### Quality Targets

- **Branch Coverage**: ≥90% (enforced)
- **Binary Size**: <500KB optimized WASM
- **Pre-commit Speed**: <3 seconds
- **Security**: Zero known vulnerabilities
- **Complexity**: ≤10 cyclomatic complexity per function
- **Performance**: <5% regression tolerance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Core tools
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
cargo install cargo-mutants
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo install wasm-pack

# Optional tools for enhanced analysis
cargo install cargo-geiger  # Security analysis
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt  # Dashboard generation
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run complete framework (all phases)
./scripts/wasm-qa-framework.sh

# Run specific phase
./scripts/wasm-qa-framework.sh --mode quality

# Run with fail-fast behavior
./scripts/wasm-qa-framework.sh --fail-fast

# Get help
./scripts/wasm-qa-framework.sh --help
```

## 📋 Framework Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Objective**: Establish basic quality infrastructure and coverage baselines

**Components**:
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks (<3s execution time)
- ✅ Unified coverage collection (native + WASM)
- ✅ Size analysis and optimization
- ✅ Cross-platform test framework

**Scripts**:
- `scripts/coverage-unified.sh` - 90% branch coverage enforcement
- `scripts/size-analysis.sh` - Binary size monitoring
- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Fast quality gates

### Phase 2: Browser Testing
**Objective**: Validate WASM functionality across browser environments

**Components**:
- ✅ E2E browser compatibility testing
- ✅ FFI boundary validation
- ✅ Memory leak detection
- ✅ Performance benchmarks

**Scripts**:
- `e2e-tests/` - Vitest-based browser testing
- `tests/wasm_memory_leak_detection.rs` - Memory safety validation
- `tests/browser_compat.rs` - Cross-browser compatibility

### Phase 3: Quality Gates
**Objective**: Comprehensive quality analysis and security validation

**Components**:
- ✅ Mutation testing (75% score threshold)
- ✅ Complexity analysis (≤10 cyclomatic complexity)
- ✅ Security scanning (zero vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Quality metrics dashboard

**Scripts**:
- `scripts/complexity-analysis.sh` - Complexity thresholds enforcement
- `scripts/security-scan.sh` - Multi-layer security validation
- `scripts/generate-dashboard.py` - Interactive quality dashboard
- `mutants.toml` - Mutation testing configuration

### Phase 4: Optimization
**Objective**: Performance analysis and regression detection

**Components**:
- ✅ Performance regression detection (5% threshold)
- ✅ Critical path optimization analysis
- ✅ Differential testing (debug vs release)
- ✅ Memory allocation profiling

**Scripts**:
- `scripts/performance-regression.sh` - Automated regression detection
- `scripts/critical-path-optimization.sh` - Hot path analysis
- `scripts/differential-testing.sh` - Cross-platform consistency

## 🔧 Configuration

### Cargo.toml Profiles
```toml
[profile.coverage]
inherits = "test"
debug = 2
opt-level = 0
overflow-checks = true

[profile.wasm-test]
inherits = "test"
opt-level = "s"
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
```

### Pre-commit Hook Configuration
The framework installs optimized pre-commit hooks that:
- Run in <3 seconds (requirement)
- Check formatting with `cargo fmt --check`
- Run clippy with project-specific lints
- Detect SATD markers (TODO, FIXME, HACK)
- Validate basic compilation

### Mutation Testing Configuration
```toml
# mutants.toml
minimum_test_timeout = "10s"
timeout_multiplier = 1.5
jobs = 2
examine_globs = ["src/frontend/**", "src/backend/**", "src/runtime/**", "src/wasm/**"]
```

## 📈 CI/CD Integration

## 🔍 Quality Gate Details

### Blocking Quality Gates
These gates will fail the entire framework if not met:

1. **Security Gate**: Zero known vulnerabilities
2. **Coverage Gate**: ≥90% branch coverage
3. **Complexity Gate**: No functions >10 cyclomatic complexity
4. **Compilation Gate**: All targets must compile successfully

### Warning Quality Gates
These gates generate warnings but don't fail the framework:

1. **Performance Gate**: Regressions >5% (configurable)
2. **Size Gate**: WASM binaries >500KB
3. **Documentation Gate**: <70% API documentation coverage

## 📚 Framework Philosophy

This framework implements several key quality principles:

### Toyota Way Integration
- **Jidoka**: Stop the line for any defect (fail-fast mode)
- **Genchi Genbutsu**: Go to the source (detailed error reporting)
- **Kaizen**: Continuous improvement (trend monitoring)

### Extreme Programming (XP)
- **TDD**: Test-driven development encouraged
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated quality gates
- **Refactoring**: Complexity limits enforce clean code

### DevOps Best Practices
- **Shift Left**: Quality gates in development phase
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Reproducible quality environment
- **Monitoring**: Continuous quality metrics tracking

## 🤝 Contributing

### Adding New Quality Checks
1. Create script in `scripts/` directory
2. Follow naming convention: `{category}-{function}.sh`
3. Ensure <30s execution time for CI compatibility
4. Add integration to `wasm-qa-framework.sh`
5. Update documentation

### Extending Browser Tests
1. Add tests to `e2e-tests/` directory
2. Follow Vitest conventions
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
