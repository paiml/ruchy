audit_report:
  date: 2025-10-15
  auditor: Gemini
  project: Ruchy Language
  scope: Language features and documentation analysis based on source code.

sections:
  - title: "What Works"
    findings:
      - "The project has a very mature and well-defined structure."
      - "The compiler architecture is well-designed, with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend, middleend, and backend."
      - "The language supports multiple backends: a compiler, a transpiler, and a WebAssembly target."
      - "The 'ruchy-book' is not just a language specification, but a comprehensive validation report for each feature, including links to examples and detailed test coverage information."
      - "The project has a strict set of quality gates defined in `.pmat.toml`, which includes metrics for cyclomatic complexity, test coverage, and mutation score."
      - "The project enforces a 'no self-admitted technical debt' policy."
      - "The basic syntax of the language, as documented in the first chapter of the 'ruchy-book', appears to be well-defined and implemented."

  - title: "What Does Not Work (or is Unclear)"
    findings:
      - "The full extent of the language's features is not immediately clear from the current state of the 'ruchy-book', as only the first chapter is complete."
      - "It is unclear how to navigate the 'ruchy-book' to get a complete picture of the language. The table of contents seems to be missing or incomplete."
      - "The purpose of the `ruchy-cli` is unclear, as the documentation mentions its deprecation."

  - title: "Bugs Found"
    findings:
      - "No bugs were found during this audit, as the analysis was based on source code review and not on execution."

  - title: "Summary and Suggestions"
    summary: "The Ruchy language project is in an excellent state. The codebase is well-organized, the architecture is robust, and the commitment to quality is evident from the extensive testing and quality gates. The 'ruchy-book' is a fantastic resource, but its current state makes it difficult to get a complete overview of the language."
    suggestions:
      - "Complete the 'ruchy-book' to cover all language features. This will provide a comprehensive resource for users and contributors."
      - "Add a table of contents or an index to the 'ruchy-book' to make it easier to navigate."
      - "Clarify the status of the `ruchy-cli` in the documentation. If it is deprecated, provide guidance on what to use instead."
      - "Consider adding a high-level overview of the language's features to the main `README.md` file to give new users a quick introduction to what Ruchy can do."
