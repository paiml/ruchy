# Actor System Implementation Status

## Current State (v3.55.0)

### ✅ What Works

#### Parser Support (Complete)
- Actor definitions with state fields
- Receive blocks with pattern matching
- Message handlers with parameters
- Spawn expressions
- Send operations (`.send()` method)
- Ask operations (`.ask()` method)

#### Basic Runtime (Partial)
- Actor definitions are recognized as a type
- Spawn syntax is parsed but creates regular objects
- Send/ask methods return placeholder values

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

#### Runtime Limitations
1. **No Real Message Passing**: Messages are not actually queued or processed
2. **No Concurrency**: Actors run in the same thread, not isolated
3. **No State Persistence**: Like mutable self in classes, actor state changes aren't persisted
4. **No Mailbox**: Messages aren't stored or processed in order
5. **No Supervision**: No supervisor trees or error recovery

## Test Coverage

### Current Status
- **Parser tests**: 14/17 passing (82.4%)
- **Runtime tests**: 2/24 passing (8.3%)
- **Overall actor coverage**: ~45%

### Failing Tests Categories
1. **State modification tests**: Require persistent mutable state
2. **Message ordering tests**: Need proper message queue
3. **Concurrent execution tests**: Need threading/async runtime
4. **Supervision tests**: Need error handling infrastructure

## Architectural Requirements

To complete the actor system, we need:

### 1. Message Queue Infrastructure
```rust
struct ActorMailbox {
    messages: VecDeque<Message>,
    capacity: usize,
}
```

### 2. Actor Runtime
```rust
struct ActorRuntime {
    actors: HashMap<ActorId, ActorState>,
    scheduler: MessageScheduler,
}
```

### 3. State Management
- Similar to mutable self issue in classes
- Need to track and update actor state after message processing
- Requires architectural refactoring

## Comparison with Classes

Both actors and classes suffer from the same core issue:
- **Classes**: Methods with `&mut self` don't persist changes
- **Actors**: Message handlers that modify state don't persist changes

The root cause is the same: we clone state for processing but never update the original.

## Recommendation

The actor system requires significant architectural work similar to fixing mutable self in classes. These should be addressed together in a dedicated refactoring sprint focusing on:

1. Reference tracking for mutable objects
2. State persistence after mutations
3. Proper isolation and concurrency primitives

## Usage Warning

While actor syntax is parsed correctly, the runtime behavior is incomplete. Users should not rely on actors for:
- Concurrent processing
- Message ordering guarantees
- State persistence
- Error isolation

The current implementation is suitable only for:
- Syntax validation
- Basic structural testing
- Future development foundation
