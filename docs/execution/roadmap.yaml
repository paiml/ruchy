      Implemented method call support in bytecode VM using hybrid execution model.
      Stores method call AST in chunk, delegates to interpreter for complex dispatch.
      Supports all stdlib methods (mutating, DataFrame, Actor) without reimplementation.

      - "Compiler: Emits OpCode::MethodCall with index into method_calls table"

      Parser entered infinite loop when parsing actor definitions with 'fun' keyword.
      This was a critical bug causing test timeouts and potential production hangs.

      Example that hanged:
      ```ruchy
      actor Counter {
          state { count: i32 }
          fun increment() { self.count += 1 }
      }
      ```

      Root cause: parse_actor_state_fields() loop didn't exit on Token::Fun.
      When it encountered 'fun' keyword, should_exit_state_parsing() returned false,
      and parse_single_state_field() returned Ok(()) without consuming token.
    fix:
      - "Added Token::Fun check to should_exit_state_parsing()"

    severity: "High - blocks advanced content deployment"
    bug_report: "../interactive.paiml.com/wasm/ruchy/BUG_ADVANCED_FEATURES_NOT_IN_WASM.md"
    root_cause: |
      WASM parser missing fundamental Rust language features:
      1. Path/namespace operator (::) - Vec::new(), HashMap::new()
      2. Use declarations - use std::collections::HashMap
      3. Generic type parameters - Vec<T>, HashMap<K,V>
      4. Turbofish syntax - collect::<Vec<_>>()
      5. Standard library bindings - Vec, HashMap, HashSet

    why_not_p0: |
      - Core book (chapters 1-9) is functional and deployed
      - println stdout capture fix (feee4c38) unblocked production launch
      - Advanced features require substantial parser work (weeks not days)
      - Current deployment provides beginner-intermediate learning path
