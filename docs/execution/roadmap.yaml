      Parser entered infinite loop when parsing actor definitions with 'fun' keyword.
      This was a critical bug causing test timeouts and potential production hangs.

      Example that hanged:
      ```ruchy
      actor Counter {
          state { count: i32 }

      }

      Root cause: parse_actor_state_fields() loop didn't exit on Token::Fun.
      When it encountered 'fun' keyword, should_exit_state_parsing() returned false,
      and parse_single_state_field() returned Ok(()) without consuming token.
    fix:

    severity: "High - blocks advanced content deployment"
    bug_report: "../interactive.paiml.com/wasm/ruchy/BUG_ADVANCED_FEATURES_NOT_IN_WASM.md"
    root_cause: |
      WASM parser missing fundamental Rust language features:
      1. Path/namespace operator (::) - Vec::new(), HashMap::new()
      2. Use declarations - use std::collections::HashMap
      3. Generic type parameters - Vec<T>, HashMap<K,V>
      4. Turbofish syntax - collect::<Vec<_>>()
      5. Standard library bindings - Vec, HashMap, HashSet

    why_not_p0: |
      - Core book (chapters 1-9) is functional and deployed
      - println stdout capture fix (feee4c38) unblocked production launch
      - Advanced features require substantial parser work (weeks not days)
      - Current deployment provides beginner-intermediate learning path
