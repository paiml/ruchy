    description: |
      Parser entered infinite loop when parsing actor definitions with 'fun' keyword.
      This was a critical bug causing test timeouts and potential production hangs.

      Example that hanged:
      ```ruchy
      actor Counter {
          state { count: i32 }
          fun increment() { self.count += 1 }
      }
      ```

      Root cause: parse_actor_state_fields() loop didn't exit on Token::Fun.
      When it encountered 'fun' keyword, should_exit_state_parsing() returned false,
      and parse_single_state_field() returned Ok(()) without consuming token.
    fix:
      - "Added Token::Fun check to should_exit_state_parsing()"
      - "Implemented parse_fun_handler() to handle 'fun' keyword in actor bodies"

      Coverage always reported 0/0 = 100% (meaningless).
      Impact: Cannot measure actual code coverage.
      Root cause: execute_with_coverage() never called analyze_file().
    fix:
      - "Added self.analyze_file(file_path)? call before execution"
      - "Single line fix that populates total_lines and total_functions"
      - "Then covered lines/functions give real percentages"

    impact:

        pattern: "Inline Value::Integer/Float/Bool/String conversion match expressions"
        status: "STILL PRESENT - transformation.rs never integrated"
    findings:
      - "‚úÖ transformation.rs module EXISTS (252 LOC) with centralized logic"
      - "‚úÖ Module has comprehensive tests (unit + property + mutation)"
      - "‚úÖ Module documentation: 'PMAT found DataTransformation pattern repeated 10 times (792 lines)'"
      - "‚ùå Module is COMPLETELY UNUSED - zero imports found (rg 'use.*transformation')"
      - "‚ùå Duplication STILL EXISTS across 18 files with inline conversion patterns"
      - "‚ùå Original problem: transformation.rs was created but NEVER INTEGRATED"
    verification:
      method: "Grep search for imports and conversion patterns"
      date: "2025-10-11"
      commands:
        - "rg 'use.*transformation' src/ (0 results)"
        - "rg 'DataTransformation' src/ (1 result: transformation.rs itself)"
        - "rg 'match.*Value::(Integer|Float|Bool|String)' src/runtime/ (18 files)"
      evidence: "transformation.rs exists but no files import it"
    recommendation: "Option B - Remove transformation.rs as dead code (252 LOC)"
    rationale: "Module was created to solve duplication but never integrated. Since it's unused with zero imports, it's pure dead code. Integrating it would require 40h of high-risk refactoring with extensive testing. Better to remove dead code now."

    root_cause: |
      WASM parser missing fundamental Rust language features:
      1. Path/namespace operator (::) - Vec::new(), HashMap::new()
      2. Use declarations - use std::collections::HashMap
      3. Generic type parameters - Vec<T>, HashMap<K,V>
      4. Turbofish syntax - collect::<Vec<_>>()
      5. Standard library bindings - Vec, HashMap, HashSet

      - Core book (chapters 1-9) is functional and deployed
      - println stdout capture fix (feee4c38) unblocked production launch

    Fix two language-level bugs discovered during HTTP-002-D HTML validation:
    1. PARSER-081: Array literals with identifiers not supported (e.g., [title, count])
    2. EVALUATOR-002: Method chaining with array indexing returns empty string

    Both bugs have been proven non-HTML-specific via test_method_chaining_simulation() in html.rs:424.
