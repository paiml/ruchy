      Parser entered infinite loop when parsing actor definitions with 'fun' keyword.
      This was a critical bug causing test timeouts and potential production hangs.

      Example that hanged:
      ```ruchy
      actor Counter {

          fun increment() { self.count += 1 }
      }

      Root cause: parse_actor_state_fields() loop didn't exit on Token::Fun.
      When it encountered 'fun' keyword, should_exit_state_parsing() returned false,
      and parse_single_state_field() returned Ok(()) without consuming token.

      @test("description") transpiled to #[test(description)] which is invalid Rust.
