        status: "STILL PRESENT - transformation.rs never integrated"
    findings:
      - "✅ transformation.rs module EXISTS (252 LOC) with centralized logic"
      - "✅ Module has comprehensive tests (unit + property + mutation)"
      - "✅ Module documentation: 'PMAT found DataTransformation pattern repeated 10 times (792 lines)'"
      - "❌ Module is COMPLETELY UNUSED - zero imports found (rg 'use.*transformation')"
      - "❌ Duplication STILL EXISTS across 18 files with inline conversion patterns"
      - "❌ Original problem: transformation.rs was created but NEVER INTEGRATED"
    verification:
      method: "Grep search for imports and conversion patterns"
      date: "2025-10-11"
      commands:
        - "rg 'use.*transformation' src/ (0 results)"
        - "rg 'DataTransformation' src/ (1 result: transformation.rs itself)"
        - "rg 'match.*Value::(Integer|Float|Bool|String)' src/runtime/ (18 files)"
      evidence: "transformation.rs exists but no files import it"
    recommendation: "Option B - Remove transformation.rs as dead code (252 LOC)"
    rationale: "Module was created to solve duplication but never integrated. Since it's unused with zero imports, it's pure dead code. Integrating it would require 40h of high-risk refactoring with extensive testing. Better to remove dead code now."
