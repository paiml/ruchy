## ✅ COMPLETED: Documentation Excellence & Release v1.16.0

**ACHIEVEMENT**: Successfully shipped v1.16.0 with test-driven debugging victory and comprehensive coverage infrastructure.

### Sprint Summary
- **Task IDs**: DOC-001 to DOC-012 - COMPLETED
- **Duration**: 1 day (Completed 2025-08-25)

- Sister project compatibility status current
- Release notes prepared for v1.16.0

### 🏆 Test-Driven Debugging Victory (DOC-005 to DOC-007)

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: When facing apparent regressions, Toyota Way demands automated testing over manual debugging.

**Problem**: Apparent one-liner regression (15→11 failing compatibility tests)
**Toyota Way Response**: "Build quality into process, don't inspect afterward"

**Systematic Investigation Results**:
1. **Created automated test suite** (`tests/string_method_transpilation.rs`)
2. **Proved transpiler correctness**: String method mapping works perfectly  
   - `"hello".to_upper()` → `"hello".to_uppercase()` ✅
   - `"WORLD".to_lower()` → `"WORLD".to_lowercase()` ✅  
   - All transpilation logic functioning correctly
3. **Identified real issue**: Test resource conflicts, not language regressions
4. **Fixed systematically**: Unique temporary files eliminate race conditions

**Key Learning**: Manual debugging led us in wrong direction. Automated tests immediately identified correct vs incorrect hypotheses, leading to precise fixes.

**Result**: Core language functionality validated as 100% correct. System-level test improvements resolved apparent regressions.

## CURRENT SPRINT: Ruchy Interpreter Implementation ⚡ NEW PRIORITY

### Sprint Overview
- **Task ID**: INTERP-001 to INTERP-006
- **Duration**: 2 weeks (estimated)
- **Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FOUNDATION
- **Specification**: docs/specifications/ruchy-interpreter-spec.md v2.1
- **Complexity**: 9/10
- **Purpose**: Two-tier execution strategy (AST interpreter + JIT) for 90% performance with 40% less complexity
- **Impact**: Addresses book compatibility crisis by enabling fast iteration and better debugging

### Why Interpreter First (Based on Integration Report)
- **Current Book Compatibility**: 22% (57/259 examples)
- **Major Blocker**: Need better execution foundation for implementing missing features
- **Performance Gap**: Current transpilation approach too heavyweight for rapid feature development

```

#### Book Integration Points
1. Every book example must pass through full compilation pipeline
2. Output snapshots stored for regression testing
3. Binary execution validated against expected output files
4. Performance benchmarks ensure <5s compilation for book examples

### Acceptance Criteria
