## Strategic Options for Next Work

### Option 1: DataFrame Quality Enhancements (OPTIONAL - NOT BLOCKERS)

**Scope**: DF-008 and DF-009 - Additional quality validation for DataFrame
**Priority**: Medium (quality enhancements, not blockers)
**Effort**: 8-12 hours total
**Value**: Increased confidence in DataFrame implementation

#### DF-008: Additional Property Tests for Groupby/Join
**Status**: PENDING (optional)
**Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Value**: Complete property test coverage for all DataFrame operations

**What Would Be Added**:
- 10 property tests for groupby operations (10K iterations each)
- 10 property tests for join operations (10K iterations each)
- Additional 200K property test iterations
- Mathematical proofs for groupby/join invariants

**Benefits**:
- Complete mathematical proof coverage for all DataFrame ops
- Increased user confidence
- Additional regression protection

**Risks of NOT Doing**:
- Low risk - groupby/join already have unit tests
- Core operations already proven (filter, sort, aggregations)

---

#### DF-009: Mutation Testing Campaign
**Status**: PENDING (optional)
**Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Value**: Empirical test quality validation

**What Would Be Done**:
- Run cargo-mutants on all DataFrame modules

- Document test gaps and fix
- Prove tests catch real bugs (not just coverage theater)

**Benefits**:
- Empirical proof that tests are effective
- Find test gaps that property tests might miss
- Industry-standard quality validation

**Risks of NOT Doing**:
