## 📊 Detailed Analysis

### Tier 1: IMMEDIATE (This Week)

#### 🥇 RUCHY-100: Multi-arg println Fix
**Why Priority #1:**
- **User Impact**: Fixes basic "Hello World" examples that users try first
- **Technical Debt**: Eliminates fundamental language defect  
- **Implementation**: Single method change in statements.rs:954-957
- **Test Coverage**: Excellent - immediate validation available
- **Risk**: Minimal - isolated change with clear success criteria

**Success Criteria**: `println("Hello", "World", "from", "Ruchy")` outputs "Hello World from Ruchy"

#### 🥈 RUCHY-101: Complexity Refactoring  
**Why Priority #2:**
- **Development Impact**: Unblocks commit workflow (pre-commit hooks failing)
- **Quality Impact**: Enables faster development by removing barriers
- **Implementation**: PMAT tooling available for automation
- **Technical**: Well-understood refactoring patterns
- **Risk**: Low - maintain behavior while improving structure

**Success Criteria**: All functions <10 cyclomatic complexity, commits pass hooks

---

### Tier 2: STRATEGIC DECISIONS (Next Week)

#### 🤔 Architecture vs Modules Decision Point

**Option A: RUCHY-102 (Transpiler Architecture)**
- **Pros**: Fixes fundamental design issues, enables broad compatibility
- **Cons**: High complexity, touches core systems, potential for subtle bugs
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks of careful work
- **Outcome**: Statement/expression separation, better code generation

**Option B: RUCHY-103 (Multi-file Modules)**  
- **Pros**: Clear user value, well-scoped problem, good foundation exists
- **Cons**: Doesn't address transpiler architecture issues
- **Timeline**: 3-5 days focused work
- **Outcome**: Can build larger programs across multiple files

**Recommendation**: Start with RUCHY-102 (Architecture) because:
1. Fixes root cause of compatibility issues
2. Enables future features to work correctly
3. Module system depends on transpiler working properly

---

### Tier 3: CONTINUOUS (Ongoing)

#### 📊 RUCHY-104: Broader Compatibility Testing
- **Impact**: High (comprehensive validation)
- **Effort**: Medium (systematic testing)
- **Priority**: Continuous background work
- **Integration**: Run after each major change
