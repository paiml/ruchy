## Toyota Way Decision Framework

### Five Whys Analysis

**Why do we need to choose priorities?**
→ Sprint 1-2 complete, multiple paths forward

**Why multiple paths?**
→ New WASM P0 issue, parser limitations, book sync opportunities

**Why is WASM P0?**
→ 100% failure rate blocks entire deployment category

**Why not fix all issues?**
→ Limited time, must maximize value delivery

**Root Decision Factors**:
1. **WASM P0 blocker** - Highest urgency but limited book impact
2. **Book compatibility** - Highest user documentation value
3. **Parser completeness** - Removes language limitations
4. **Technical debt** - Long-term health investment

### Recommended Priority Order

**IMMEDIATE (Sprint 3)**: **Option 1 - WASM Fix**
- **Rationale**: P0 blocker, blocks entire deployment path
- **Risk**: If WASM unfixable in 6 days, pivot to Option 3
- **Success Metric**: Valid WASM modules generated

**NEXT (Sprint 4)**: **Option 3 - Book Sync**
- **Rationale**: Maximum compatibility improvement (83%→90%+)
- **Dependencies**: None (can start immediately after WASM)
- **Success Metric**: 90%+ book compatibility

**FUTURE (Sprint 5)**: **Option 2 - Parser Hardening**
- **Rationale**: Complete fundamental features
- **Dependencies**: May benefit from book sync insights
- **Success Metric**: All control flow tests passing

**CONTINUOUS**: **Option 4 - Quality/Performance**
- **Rationale**: Ongoing refactoring during feature work
- **Approach**: Apply <10 complexity to all new code
- **Success Metric**: Incremental PMAT score improvement
