## Upstream Impact & Feedback

### Development Priorities Validated
**Immediate (Weeks 1-2):**
1. **Standard Library Foundation** - `map`, `filter`, `reduce` for real system scripts
2. **Pattern Matching Runtime** - Critical for configuration logic patterns

**Short-term (Weeks 3-6):**  
3. **System Operations** - File I/O, process execution for actual system work
4. **Error Handling** - Result/Option types for robust system programming

**Medium-term (Weeks 7-10):**
5. **Advanced Integration** - Async/await, networking for complete system control

### Performance Validation
- **Compilation Speed**: 4-5ms proves excellent for development workflow
- **Memory Efficiency**: 6MB footprint suitable for system scripts
- **Runtime Performance**: 4-5ms execution validates design decisions
- **Stability**: 100% success rate on core features builds confidence

### Real-World Usage Patterns
- **System Configuration**: Audio, hardware, package management patterns
- **Error Handling**: Robust failure modes and recovery strategies
- **Integration Points**: External tool coordination and data flow
- **Testing Approaches**: Property-based testing for system operations
