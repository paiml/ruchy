# BUG-001: Major v1.17.0 Book Regression

## Ticket Information
- **ID**: BUG-001
- **Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
- **Severity**: BLOCKER
- **Component**: Compiler/Parser/Interpreter
- **Reported**: 2025-08-26
- **Reporter**: Integration Testing
- **Status**: OPEN

## Problem Statement
After the v1.17.0 quality sprint, book example compatibility has regressed from ~20% to 20% pass rate, with 299 out of 375 examples now failing. This is a severe regression that blocks documentation and learning materials.

## Impact
- **80% of book examples failing** (299/375)
- Blocks new user onboarding
- Makes documentation unreliable
- Regression from previous versions

## Symptoms
- Examples that previously passed now fail
- Stricter validation may be rejecting valid code
- Parser/interpreter disconnect

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone ruchy-book repository
2. Run integration tests against v1.17.0
3. Observe 80% failure rate

## Expected Behavior
- Book examples should have high pass rate (>70%)
- Quality improvements should not break existing valid code

## Actual Behavior
- 80% failure rate
- Many previously working examples now broken

## Root Cause Analysis Needed
1. Compare v1.16.0 vs v1.17.0 behavior
2. Identify what quality changes broke compatibility
3. Determine if changes are too strict

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Book example pass rate restored to >70%
- [ ] No regression in quality metrics
- [ ] All TDD test examples passing
- [ ] CI/CD integration tests passing

## Technical Notes
- May need to relax some validation rules
- Consider backward compatibility mode
- Add integration tests to prevent future regressions
