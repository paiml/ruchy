# QUALITY-009: Integration Testing Suite

## Summary
Create comprehensive end-to-end integration tests to complement unit tests and achieve more effective testing of complex, cross-module functionality.

## Background
Coverage sprint revealed that unit tests are less effective for complex modules like REPL and cross-cutting functionality. Integration tests provide better coverage and more realistic validation of system behavior.

## Scope

### End-to-End Compilation Tests
- Complete source-to-binary compilation workflows
- Multi-file project compilation
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Performance and memory usage validation

### REPL Integration Testing
- Interactive command sequences
- Session state management
- Multi-line input handling
- Command history and completion

### Cross-Module Integration
- Parser → AST → Transpiler → Output workflows
- Error propagation across module boundaries
- State consistency between components
- Resource management and cleanup

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: E2E Compilation Tests (5-7 days)

#### Test Categories
1. **Single File Programs**
   ```ruchy
   // Simple programs that should compile successfully
   fun main() { println("Hello, World!") }
   ```

2. **Multi-File Projects**
   ```
   src/
   ├── main.ruchy
   ├── lib.ruchy
   └── utils/
       └── helpers.ruchy
   ```

3. **Error Scenarios**
   - Syntax errors with helpful messages
   - Type errors with context
   - Runtime errors with stack traces

#### Infrastructure
- Test harness for compilation workflows
- Golden file testing for expected outputs
- Performance benchmarking integration
- Memory usage monitoring

### Phase 2: REPL Integration Tests (3-5 days)

#### Interactive Scenarios
1. **Basic REPL Operations**
   ```
   > let x = 42
   > x + 8
   50
   > :type x
   i32
   ```

2. **Multi-line Input**
   ```
   > fun factorial(n) {
   ... if n <= 1 { 1 } else { n * factorial(n-1) }
   ... }
   > factorial(5)
   120
   ```

3. **Session State**
   - Variable persistence across commands
   - Function definitions and calls
   - Error recovery without losing state

#### Testing Approach
- Automated REPL interaction scripts
- Expected output validation
- State assertions between commands
- Performance and memory monitoring

### Phase 3: Cross-Module Integration (4-6 days)

#### Integration Points
1. **Parser → Transpiler**
   - AST correctness validation
   - Error propagation testing
   - Performance optimization validation

2. **Transpiler → Runtime**
   - Generated code execution
   - Runtime error handling
   - Memory management validation

3. **REPL → All Modules**
   - Interactive compilation testing
   - Real-time error feedback
   - Performance in interactive mode

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Targets
- **50+ integration test scenarios**
- **90%+ success rate** on realistic programs
- **<100ms latency** for typical operations
- **Memory usage** within expected bounds

### Quality Improvements
- **Catch bugs** that unit tests miss
- **Validate workflows** end-to-end
- **Performance regression** detection
- **User experience** validation

### Coverage Impact
- **Complement unit tests** rather than replace
- **Exercise real-world scenarios**
- **Test error paths** comprehensively
- **Validate assumptions** across modules

## Technical Architecture

### Test Harness Design
```rust
pub struct IntegrationTestHarness {
    workspace: TempDir,
    compiler: CompilerInstance,
    repl: ReplInstance,
    performance_monitor: PerformanceTracker,
}

impl IntegrationTestHarness {
    pub fn compile_program(&mut self, source: &str) -> CompilationResult;
    pub fn run_repl_sequence(&mut self, commands: &[&str]) -> ReplResult;
    pub fn validate_output(&self, expected: &str, actual: &str) -> bool;
    pub fn measure_performance(&self) -> PerformanceMetrics;
}
```

### Golden File Testing
- Store expected outputs for regression testing
- Automatic update mechanism for intentional changes
- Diff visualization for debugging failures
- Version control friendly formats
