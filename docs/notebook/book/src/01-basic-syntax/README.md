# Basic Syntax

## Overview

The foundation of any language is its basic syntax: how you write values, store data, and annotate code.

Ruchy's basic syntax is designed to be **familiar** (if you know Python, Ruby, or Rust) and **safe** (strict typing, no implicit conversions).

## Features in This Chapter

1. **Literals** - How to write numbers, strings, booleans, and nil
2. **Variables & Assignment** - How to store and update values
3. **Comments** - How to document your code
