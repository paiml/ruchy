# Advanced Features

This section covers the advanced features of Ruchy (Features 31-42) that enable sophisticated programming patterns, zero-cost abstractions, and systems-level control.

## What You'll Learn

### Type System Mastery
- **Generics** (Feature 31): Write type-safe, reusable code with generic functions, structs, and enums
- **Traits** (Feature 32): Define shared behavior with interfaces and polymorphism
- **Lifetimes** (Feature 33): Ensure memory safety with compile-time lifetime tracking

### Asynchronous Programming
- **Async/Await** (Feature 34): Write non-blocking code that looks synchronous
- **Futures** (Feature 35): Master the foundation of async programming with Future combinators

### Concurrency & Safety
- **Concurrency** (Feature 36): Parallel execution with threads, channels, and synchronization primitives
- **FFI & Unsafe** (Feature 37): Interop with C libraries and low-level system control

### Metaprogramming
- **Macros** (Feature 38): Compile-time code generation with declarative and procedural macros
- **Metaprogramming** (Feature 39): Reflection, const evaluation, and type-level programming

### Design & Performance
- **Advanced Patterns** (Feature 40): Builder, Type State, Newtype, Visitor, RAII, Strategy patterns
- **Optimization** (Feature 41): Profiling, iterator optimization, and zero-cost abstractions
- **Testing** (Feature 42): Comprehensive testing strategies with unit, property, and mutation tests

## Who Should Read This

This section is for developers who:
- Want to master Ruchy's advanced features
- Need to write high-performance, systems-level code
- Are building libraries or frameworks
- Want to understand zero-cost abstractions
- Need concurrent or async programming capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this section, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic syntax (variables, operators, control flow)
- Data structures (arrays, structs, enums)
- Pattern matching and error handling
- Standard library basics

## Quality Standards

Every feature in this section is:
- ✅ **100% tested** with comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ **Property tested** with 10,000+ random inputs
- ✅ **Mutation tested** with 88-97% mutation scores
- ✅ **Production-ready** with zero known bugs
