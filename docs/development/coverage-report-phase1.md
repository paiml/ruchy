**Overall Transpiler Coverage: 54.85%** (Target: 70%)

### Project-Wide Coverage
- **Total Line Coverage**: 37.13% (up from 35.86%)
- **Function Coverage**: 40.64%
- **Branch Coverage**: 38.71%

## Test Infrastructure Created

### New Test Files
1. `tests/transpiler_coverage.rs` - 21 comprehensive transpiler tests
2. `tests/transpiler_patterns.rs` - Pattern matching test suite
3. `tests/transpiler_statements.rs` - Statement transpilation tests
4. `tests/transpiler_low_coverage.rs` - Targeting specific gaps

### Test Categories Covered
- ✅ Literals (all types)
- ✅ Binary operators (arithmetic, logical, bitwise)
- ✅ Unary operators
- ✅ Control flow (if/else, match, for, while)
- ✅ Functions and lambdas
- ✅ Arrays and indexing
- ✅ Structs/objects
- ✅ Method calls (including string methods)
- ✅ String interpolation
- ✅ Async/await
- ✅ Tuples and ranges
- ✅ Type annotations
- ⚠️ Pattern matching (partial)
- ⚠️ Result/Option types (partial)
- ⚠️ DataFrame operations (partial)

## Gap Analysis for 70% Target

### Required Improvements
To reach 70% transpiler coverage, we need:
- **patterns.rs**: 14% → 40% (+26 points)
- **result_type.rs**: 12% → 40% (+28 points)
- **types.rs**: 36% → 60% (+24 points)
- **dispatcher.rs**: 40% → 60% (+20 points)

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate**: Add doctests to low-coverage modules
2. **Short-term**: Create property-based tests for pattern matching
3. **Medium-term**: Add integration tests for complex transpilation scenarios
4. **Long-term**: Implement fuzzing for transpiler robustness

## Next Phase: Interpreter Coverage (62% → 85%)

### Current Interpreter Coverage
- `runtime/interpreter.rs`: 62.24%
- `runtime/value.rs`: 58.45%
- `runtime/builtins.rs`: 45.23%

### Strategy for 85% Target
1. Test all built-in functions comprehensively
2. Add edge case tests for value operations
3. Create property tests for interpreter invariants
4. Test error handling paths

## Conclusion

Phase 1 transpiler coverage improvement has made significant progress but falls short of the 70% target. The foundation is solid with comprehensive test infrastructure in place. Focus should shift to:

1. Completing transpiler coverage to 70% (15.15% gap remaining)
2. Beginning interpreter coverage improvements (23% gap to 85%)
3. Maintaining zero regression policy on existing coverage

**Recommendation**: Continue with targeted unit tests for low-coverage modules before moving to Phase 2.
