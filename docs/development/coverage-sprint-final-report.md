| result_type.rs | 12% | 12% | 0% | 🔴 No change |

## ❌ Challenges Encountered

### 1. Parser Limitations
Many comprehensive tests failed due to parser not supporting:
- Complex pattern matching syntax
- Pattern guards
- Or patterns
- Rest patterns (..)
- String interpolation edge cases

### 2. Coverage Calculation Issues
- Doctests don't immediately reflect in coverage metrics
- Unit tests in modules not executing all code paths
- Integration tests not reaching deep transpiler logic

### 3. Test Compilation Errors
- Type system tests had compilation issues
- AST construction APIs not matching expected signatures
- Missing helper methods for test setup

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Coverage Plateaued at 54.85%

1. **Parser Bottleneck**: 
   - Can't test transpiler features the parser doesn't support
   - Complex patterns and expressions fail to parse

2. **Dead Code**:
   - Some transpiler paths may be unreachable
   - Functions marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]` not counted

3. **Test Strategy Mismatch**:
   - Unit tests too granular, missing integration points
   - Integration tests too high-level, not exercising all paths

4. **Missing Test Helpers**:
   - No AST builder for programmatic test construction
   - Relying on parser limits testable scenarios

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Quick Wins**: actors.rs and dataframe.rs saw major improvements
2. **Infrastructure**: Coverage tooling now in place for future work
3. **Documentation**: Clear path to 70% identified

### What Didn't Work
1. **Comprehensive Pattern Tests**: Parser limitations blocked testing
2. **Property-Based Testing**: Not implemented due to time constraints
3. **Doctest Coverage**: Didn't translate to metric improvements

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Quick Wins)
1. **Fix Parser**: Enable missing pattern syntax support
2. **AST Builder**: Create test helper for direct AST construction
3. **Remove Dead Code**: Clean up unreachable paths

### Short-Term (1-2 days)
1. **Golden Tests**: Compare transpiled output to expected Rust
2. **Snapshot Testing**: Capture and verify transpilation results
3. **Fuzzing**: Random input generation for edge cases

### Long-Term Strategy
1. **Refactor Transpiler**: Simplify complex functions for testability
2. **Mock Parser**: Test transpiler independently of parser
3. **Coverage Gates**: Enforce minimum coverage in CI/CD

## 📈 Path Forward

### To Reach 70% Coverage
1. **Fix prerequisites** (parser, test helpers): 1 day
2. **Re-enable comprehensive tests**: 1 day  
3. **Add golden/snapshot tests**: 1 day
4. **Target specific gaps**: 1 day

**Estimated Time**: 4 days with prerequisites fixed

### Alternative Approach
If parser fixes are out of scope:
1. Focus on **interpreter coverage** (62% → 85%)
2. Use **direct AST construction** for transpiler tests
3. Accept 55% as current transpiler baseline

## 🏁 Conclusion

The coverage sprint established crucial infrastructure and identified clear bottlenecks. While the 70% target wasn't reached, the 22.71% improvement and comprehensive test suite provide a solid foundation for future work.

**Key Achievement**: Infrastructure and knowledge gained will accelerate future coverage improvements.

**Critical Blocker**: Parser limitations prevent testing many transpiler features.

**Recommendation**: Fix parser support for complex patterns before continuing transpiler coverage work, or pivot to interpreter coverage where parser limitations are less impactful.
