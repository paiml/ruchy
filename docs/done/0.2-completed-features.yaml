      priority: high
      description: Support for {variable} syntax in strings
      implementation:
        - Parse interpolation markers in strings
        - Convert to Rust format! macro
        - Support in println! and other formatters

  method_syntax:
    - task: Support method call syntax
      status: completed
      date_completed: 2025-01-16
      priority: medium
      description: Parse and transpile x.method() syntax
      implementation:
        - Added Dot token handling
        - Parse method calls with arguments
        - Support method chaining
        - Type inference for common methods (len, push, pop, chars)
        - Transpilation to Rust method calls

  repl_improvements:
    - task: Fix REPL evaluation
      status: completed
      date_completed: 2025-01-15
      priority: high
      description: Correctly handle expressions vs statements in REPL
      solution:
        - Differentiate between expressions and statements
        - Wrap expressions for result printing
        - Execute statements directly
        
    - task: Add type inference to REPL
      status: completed
      date_completed: 2025-01-16
      priority: high
      description: :type command now shows actual inferred types
      implementation:
        - Integrated InferenceContext with REPL
        - Show type errors when inference fails
        - Color-coded output for types

  import_system:
    - task: Implement import statement parsing
      status: completed
      date_completed: 2025-01-15
      priority: high
      description: Parse import/use statements with :: paths
      implementation:
        - Support for :: path separators
        - Parse braced imports like {Read, Write}
        - Generate appropriate AST nodes
        - Basic transpilation (as comments for now)
