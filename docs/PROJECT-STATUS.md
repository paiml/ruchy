## 📊 Overall Progress
- **Version**: v0.3.1
- **Total Features**: 49
- **Completed**: 26 (53%)
- **Pending**: 23 (47%)
- **Test Coverage**: ~78% (estimated)
- **Tests**: ~220 passing (estimated after recent fixes)

## ✅ Recent Accomplishments (v0.3.1)

### Actor System (COMPLETED)
- Full actor parsing with `actor` keyword and `receive` blocks
- Message passing with `!` operator (`actor ! message`)
- Synchronous ask with `?` operator (`actor ? message`)
- AST support for actors, send operations, and ask operations
- Space-separated syntax fixing REPL compatibility
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Previous v0.2.1 Features
- Lambda Expressions with full syntax support
- Type inference engine (Algorithm W)
- Method call syntax and string interpolation
- Property-based testing and fuzzing
- Zero SATD policy implementation

## 🚧 Currently In Progress
None - Ready for next feature implementation

## 🎯 Next Priority Tasks

### Critical (Blocking README Examples)
1. **DataFrame Column Operations** - Complete DataFrame support (col(), mean, std, filter, groupby, agg)
2. **Actor Transpiler Implementation** - Missing tokio::sync::mpsc integration

### High Priority
3. **Impl Blocks** - Parse impl keyword, methods with self, trait implementations
4. **Trait Definitions** - Associated types, default implementations, trait bounds
5. **Generic Type Parameters** - Parse <T> syntax, bounds, inference
6. **Object Literals** - Parse {key: value}, type inference, spread operator

## 📁 Documentation Structure

### Active Planning
- `/docs/todo/MASTER-TODO.md` - Single source of truth for all tasks
- `/docs/todo/v0.3-todo.yaml` - Detailed v0.3 work plan with PMAT validation

### Completion Records
- `/docs/done/completed-features.md` - All completed features by version
- `/docs/done/lambda-feature-completed.yaml` - Detailed lambda implementation record
- `/docs/done/0.2-completed-features.yaml` - v0.2.0 completion details
- `/docs/done/coverage-improvements-completed.yaml` - Test coverage achievements

### Archives
- `/docs/done/archived-todos/` - Historical todo files (8 files archived)

## 🏆 Quality Metrics

### Current State
- **Linting**: ✅ Zero warnings (clippy)
- **SATD**: ✅ Zero technical debt comments
- **Complexity**: ✅ All functions < 15 cyclomatic complexity
- **Tests**: ✅ 172 passing tests
- **Coverage**: ⚠️ 77.91% (target: 80%)

### Coverage by Module
- `lib.rs`: 100%
- `environment.rs`: 97.98%
- `unify.rs`: 85.71%
- `parser.rs`: 82.69%

- `transpiler.rs`: 73.58%
- `infer.rs`: 47.20% (needs improvement)

## 🛠 Development Environment

### Quality Enforcement
- PMAT MCP v2.4.0 configured
- Zero SATD policy enforced
- Cargo-llvm-cov for coverage measurement
- Pre-commit hooks for quality gates

### Build Status
- `make lint`: ✅ Passing
- `make test`: ✅ All tests passing
- `make coverage`: 77.91%

## 📈 Velocity Metrics

### v0.2.1 (Lambda Implementation)
- Estimated: 12 hours
- Actual: 3 hours
- Efficiency: 4x faster than estimated

### Overall Progress Rate
- Features per week: ~5-6

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

1. **DataFrame Support** is the highest priority as it's blocking README examples
2. **Result Type** would enable proper error handling throughout
3. Consider batching struct/trait/impl work as they're related
4. Test coverage for `infer.rs` needs improvement (currently 47.20%)
5. All lambda expression work is complete and tested
