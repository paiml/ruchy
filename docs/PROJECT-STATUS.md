## üöß Currently In Progress
None - Ready for next feature implementation

## üéØ Next Priority Tasks

### Critical (Blocking README Examples)
1. **DataFrame Support with Polars** - Essential for data science examples
2. **Result Type with ? Operator** - Error handling

### High Priority
3. **Async/Await Support** - Modern async programming
4. **Actor System** - Concurrent programming model
5. **Struct Definitions** - Custom types
6. **Impl Blocks** - Method implementations

## üìÅ Documentation Structure

### Active Planning
- `/docs/todo/MASTER-TODO.md` - Single source of truth for all tasks
- `/docs/todo/v0.3-todo.yaml` - Detailed v0.3 work plan with PMAT validation

### Completion Records
- `/docs/done/completed-features.md` - All completed features by version
- `/docs/done/lambda-feature-completed.yaml` - Detailed lambda implementation record
- `/docs/done/0.2-completed-features.yaml` - v0.2.0 completion details
- `/docs/done/coverage-improvements-completed.yaml` - Test coverage achievements

### Archives
- `/docs/done/archived-todos/` - Historical todo files (8 files archived)

## üèÜ Quality Metrics

### Current State
- **Linting**: ‚úÖ Zero warnings (clippy)
- **SATD**: ‚úÖ Zero technical debt comments
- **Complexity**: ‚úÖ All functions < 15 cyclomatic complexity
- **Tests**: ‚úÖ 172 passing tests
- **Coverage**: ‚ö†Ô∏è 77.91% (target: 80%)

### Coverage by Module
- `lib.rs`: 100%
- `environment.rs`: 97.98%
- `unify.rs`: 85.71%
- `parser.rs`: 82.69%
- `repl.rs`: 79.00%
- `types.rs`: 78.81%
- `transpiler.rs`: 73.58%
- `infer.rs`: 47.20% (needs improvement)

## üõ† Development Environment

### Quality Enforcement
- PMAT MCP v2.4.0 configured
- Zero SATD policy enforced
- Cargo-llvm-cov for coverage measurement
- Pre-commit hooks for quality gates

### Build Status
- `make lint`: ‚úÖ Passing
- `make test`: ‚úÖ All tests passing
- `make coverage`: 77.91%

## üìà Velocity Metrics

### v0.2.1 (Lambda Implementation)
- Estimated: 12 hours
- Actual: 3 hours
- Efficiency: 4x faster than estimated

### Overall Progress Rate
- Features per week: ~5-6
- Test coverage improvement: +10.84% in v0.2.0
- Zero defects in production

## üìù Notes for Next Session

1. **DataFrame Support** is the highest priority as it's blocking README examples
2. **Result Type** would enable proper error handling throughout
3. Consider batching struct/trait/impl work as they're related
4. Test coverage for `infer.rs` needs improvement (currently 47.20%)
5. All lambda expression work is complete and tested
