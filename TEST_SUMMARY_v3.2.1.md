## Areas for Future Testing

### Missing Test Coverage
1. **Concurrency**: Thread-safety testing (removed due to complexity)
2. **Performance Regression**: Automated performance regression detection
3. **Memory Leaks**: Long-running memory leak detection
4. **Large Scale**: Testing with very large datasets/programs

### Feature Tests Pending
1. **Advanced Language Features**: Some language constructs not tested
2. **DataFrame Operations**: Complete DataFrame API testing
3. **Import/Export**: Module system testing
4. **Async/Await**: Asynchronous execution testing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix the 3 failing integration tests by implementing missing features
2. Add more property-based tests for critical algorithms
3. Increase test coverage for new features as they're added

### Strategic Testing
1. Add continuous benchmark tracking
2. Implement mutation testing for test quality assessment  
3. Add chaos engineering tests for resilience
4. Create user acceptance test scenarios
