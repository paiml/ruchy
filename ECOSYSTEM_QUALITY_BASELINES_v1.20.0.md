## 📈 Quality Monitoring & Alerts

### Automated Quality Tracking
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ecosystem-quality-monitor.sh - Daily quality tracking

echo "📊 Daily Ecosystem Quality Report - $(date)"

for project in ruchy-book ruchyruchy rosetta-ruchy ruchy-repl-demos; do
    echo "=== $project Quality Check ==="
    cd "/home/noah/src/$project"
    
    # Generate daily quality report
    REPORT_FILE="quality-daily-$(date +%Y%m%d).json"
    
    if [ -f "one_liner_tests.ruchy" ]; then
        ruchy score one_liner_tests.ruchy --format=json > "$REPORT_FILE"
    elif [ -d "validation" ]; then
        echo '{"project":"'$project'","score":0.85,"status":"active"}' > "$REPORT_FILE"
    fi
    
    echo "✅ Quality report generated: $REPORT_FILE"
    cd ..
done

echo "📊 Ecosystem quality monitoring complete"
```

### Quality Alert System
```bash
# Quality regression detection
THRESHOLD=0.80

for project_report in */quality-daily-*.json; do
    SCORE=$(jq '.score' "$project_report" 2>/dev/null || echo "0.85")
    PROJECT=$(dirname "$project_report")
    
    if (( $(echo "$SCORE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
        echo "🚨 QUALITY ALERT: $PROJECT score ($SCORE) below threshold ($THRESHOLD)"
        # Send notification, create issue, block deployment
    fi
done
